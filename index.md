## Introduction

Hello! I'm Jami Biddle, I'm a first year master's student at the University of Helsinki. I'm originally from the U.S., and completed by undergrad there. I got a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Cognitive Science with a minor in Chinese from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. After studying linguistics and computer science separately in undergrad, I decided to continue on to the University of Helsinki for a Master's in Lingustic Diversity and Digital Humanities in the Language Technology track. Some of my other interests include Hockey, Aviation, and Knitting.
